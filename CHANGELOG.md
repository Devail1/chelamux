# Changelog

All notable changes to chelamux are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Tracking starts at the open-source launch (2026-07-21). Earlier development
history lives in `git log`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`chela restore` reports the rows a hard tmux death orphaned.** CMX-82 already
  self-heals the orchestrator's own address in `inbox.json`, but every other
  epoch-stamped row chela writes — `inbox.json` watches, the dispatcher's `runs`
  table (agent + judge window stamps), `session-ids.json` — had no self-initiated
  check and no report: after a tmux restart they just sit there, correct-looking
  and permanently unverifiable, invisible unless a human happens to open the right
  file. `chela restore` scans all three and prints what a dead tmux server left
  behind. It is read-only bookkeeping — it never touches a store and never
  relaunches, spawns, or resumes an agent.

- **`chela update` now refreshes the plugin too, not just the server.** A release has
  two halves: the server-side `git pull` + `uv sync` + `pm2 restart`, and the plugin
  every agent loads its hooks from — a separate copy Claude Code made at install time
  that the server-side dance never touches. `claude plugin marketplace update
  <marketplace>` and `claude plugin update <plugin>@<marketplace>` are both fully
  non-interactive, so `chela update` now runs them itself, for every marketplace an
  installed copy of the plugin came from, right after a pull. Previously this was left
  to a printed reminder telling a human to run `/plugin update` by hand — which once
  meant every agent window started after a plugin-cache sweep loaded no hooks at all,
  silently killing outbound relay until someone noticed. (#241)

- **A red `chela doctor` finding now reaches you instead of waiting to be asked.**
  Doctor findings that reach ERROR escalate through `chela notify`, edge-triggered on
  the transition into ERROR and keyed per finding, so a persistent fault reports once
  rather than on every check. The check interval was also raised from 300 s to 3600 s:
  a full `doctor.check()` measures 28–32 s on a live box, which at the old cadence was
  a ~10% permanent duty cycle. (#240)

### Fixed

- **An adopted window that never fired a hook and was never `--resume`d could not
  resolve its own session, so its outbound relay stayed dead.** Session resolution
  tried the event log, then `--resume` on the command line, then fell back to guessing
  from the working directory — and refused that guess outright when another window
  shared the same directory, which every interactive window on a single-user box does.
  It now also checks the `sessionId` that `claude agents --json` already reports for
  the window's own pid — a signal chela was fetching every refresh and discarding.
  Bounded so a recycled pid cannot inherit a dead process's session: the cwd the feed
  cached for that pid must agree with the pane's own origin, and the tier is refused
  when either is unknown. (An earlier attempt bounded it on the feed's `startedAt`
  instead; that field is the *session's* start time, not the process's fork time, and
  measuring it across every live pid on a real box gave deltas of −623 s, +16 s and
  −113 days — it disagrees in both directions, so no tolerance can rescue it.)
  Background: `docs/AGENT_IDENTITY.md`. (#239)

- **…and that fix did nothing until the processes that read it warmed their own
  cache.** The new tier reads a per-process status cache, and only the dashboard was
  populating one — so in `chela telegram` (the process that actually relays) and in the
  daemon, the tier had no data and silently fell through to the refusal it was meant to
  replace. Outbound relay stayed dead while `chela doctor` reported the window
  resolving fine, because forcing a probe warms the cache in the doctor's *own*
  process: a check that warms the thing it checks cannot observe the process that
  doesn't. Both long-lived services now warm their cache, and a cache that has never
  completed a fetch now says so rather than presenting as "the feed had nothing for
  this pid". (#243, #244)

- **The Decisions inbox search box could not be clicked.** The popover closed itself
  on any click anywhere inside it — including the click that should have focused the
  search field — so the search added alongside it was unusable with a mouse. Clicks
  inside the popover now keep it open; clicking outside still dismisses it, and
  opening a decision's ticket closes it deliberately.

### Changed

- **A pane whose status chela cannot resolve now says so, instead of claiming "idle".**
  Agent busy/idle status is matched to a pane by process id, with the working directory
  as a fallback — but on a single-user setup every agent shares one home directory, so
  that fallback would hand one agent's status to another. It now stays silent unless
  every process sharing a directory agrees, and a pane with no resolved status shows a
  muted `? unknown` rather than a confident `○ idle`. Wall ordering is unchanged.
  Background: `docs/AGENT_IDENTITY.md`.

### Fixed

- **Agent busy/idle status could silently stop updating for the whole fleet.** chela
  reads native session status by shelling out to `claude agents --json`, under a
  10-second timeout. That command's startup cost has grown past 10 s, so on affected
  machines *every* call timed out, the status cache stayed empty, and the dashboard
  drew every pane as **idle** — indistinguishable from a genuinely quiet fleet. The
  "needs you" ring, taskbar ordering, tab-title count and auto-arrange ranking all
  lost their input. Nothing surfaced it but a log line, so it could persist for
  weeks. The timeout is now 45 s and the refresh happens on a background timer
  instead of inside a web request, so a slow `claude` never stalls the dashboard.
  Both are tunable: `CHELA_STATUS_CMD_TIMEOUT_S` and `CHELA_STATUS_TTL_S`.

### Added

- **The dashboard now tells you when agent status is unavailable.** A topbar marker
  (`⚠ agent status unavailable`, shortened to `⚠ status down` on narrow screens)
  appears whenever the native status feed stops answering, so an empty status map is
  never mistaken for a calm fleet again. Backed by a new `/api/agents/status_health`
  endpoint and an `agents.native_status_feed` check in `chela doctor`, which asks the
  command directly rather than trusting a cache that was healthy before the outage.
- **`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`** — a clone-to-first-dispatched-agent quickstart.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** (Contributor Covenant 2.1) and GitHub issue/PR templates.

### Changed

- **Docs now recommend the hooks plugin.** README and the landing docs make clear
  the event-log plugin (`chela plugin`) is strongly recommended — it unlocks
  lossless blocked-agent gates on Telegram, zero-keystroke answers, and the live
  Feed — and the statusLine hook is reframed as recommended for exact usage numbers.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-23

The first tracked release: chelamux went public (MIT) and hardened through a
macOS-onboarding and fleet-safety push.

### Added

- **macOS support.** A POSIX `/proc` fallback for the process/transcript facts,
  so window attribution and `chela read` work off Linux (#183), plus a `$CHELA_WID`
  header relay for rename-proof window attribution (#181).
- **Self-update.** `chela update` command with an update-available notifier (#159),
  and an opt-in `CHELA_AUTO_UPDATE` for unattended self-update sweeps (#164).
- **`CHELA_AUTO_MERGE`** — strictly opt-in, off-by-default unattended merge sweep (#154).
- **`CHELA_WORKTREE_DISK_BUDGET`** — a disk-budget rail (the `memcap` analog for
  disk) that refuses to claim a task when a workflow's worktree root exceeds the
  ceiling (#194).
- **Telegram.** Pinned per-topic session titles, edited in place (#191); distinct
  topic names for same-cwd sessions (#163); `/compact` passthrough in the `/` menu (#149).
- **Orchestration.** A dispatcher-owned trial ledger for honest N under fan-out (#119);
  orchestrator subscribe with a durable decisions log and sidebar section (#120, #121).
- **Wall UX.** A palette-first pane switcher (Ctrl+K) (#130); a keyboard-shortcut
  cheatsheet (#135); Claude's auto-generated session title in the pane title bar and
  sidebar (#162).

### Changed

- **CI is ~30× faster** — parallelized with `pytest-xdist` and dropped the
  seed-confirm sleep (~28 min → ~1 min), capped at `-n 4` for the dev box (#188, #189).
- **Worktrees self-reap** — a run's worktree is freed at `done` (#150), judge
  (`judge-*`) worktrees are reaped, and `remove_worktree` survives all four orphan
  modes including root-owned Docker remnants (#194).
- **One shared `node_modules`** install across worktrees instead of N copies (#151).
- **`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`** in `scripts/run-chela.sh` to bound glibc arena bloat (#193).

### Fixed

- **TUI glyph tofu** (`⏺ ❌ ✅`, the working spinner, Nerd icons) across every render
  surface: `/screenshot` (#175), the collab-relay viewer (#177), the dashboard wall
  (#180), and the ttyd tmux client via `-u` (#185).
- **Dispatcher** no longer false-fails working agents, and AskUserQuestion stalls are
  auto-recovered (#187); a task whose PR merged out-of-band is never re-dispatched
  (#157); reconcile no longer false-`done`s sibling-workflow runs (#115).
- **Dispatch startup race** — MCP is isolated for dispatched agents and the judge (#146),
  and seed submit re-sends Enter instead of re-pasting (#147).
- **Gate-watcher** unpaired-`tool_use` backlog is now bounded (#193).
- **macOS** Alt+N pane-jump (Option composes characters, not digits) (#166); pane-header
  emoji rendered as SVG to kill tofu (#171).
