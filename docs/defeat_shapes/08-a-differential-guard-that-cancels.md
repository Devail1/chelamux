## 8. A differential guard that cancels

**Assertion form:** the test mounts two fixtures — the "feature on" case and a "base" case —
and asserts they *differ* (or match). Comparing against a baseline feels more robust than a
bare literal, and for a while it is.

**Mutation that defeats it:** apply the regression somewhere that moves **both** fixtures
equally. The difference is unchanged, so the assertion holds no matter how bad the absolute
value gets. A differential is blind, by construction, to anything in the common mode.

**Guard form that survives:** assert the **absolute** resolved value, not a diff — "this
resolves to `0px`", not "this resolves to the same thing the base fixture does". Keep the
second fixture as a *control* if it aids the diagnosis, but do not let it carry the assertion.

**Found:** CMX-268 round 1 (2026-08-13). The airy-density revert was guarded by comparing an
`airy` fixture's resolved padding against a no-class `base` fixture mounted from the same
stylesheet. The judge added horizontal padding to `#term-stage` **ungated** — the natural shape
of a real regression, since the gating class no longer exists — which widened both fixtures
identically. The differential held, the wall stopped filling its stage, and 3012 tests stayed
green. Round 2 replaced it with absolute assertions (`paddingLeft === '0px'`,
`maxWidth === 'none'`).

⚠️ Related but distinct from shape 6: there the coverage rested on a coincidence in the *data*;
here it rests on a property of the *comparison*.
