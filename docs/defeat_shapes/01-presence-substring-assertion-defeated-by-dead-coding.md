## 1. Presence/substring assertion defeated by dead-coding

**Assertion form:** the guard regex/string-matches the *source text* of a function body
(`assert.match(fnSource, /w.textContent = s.word/)`) instead of driving the function and
reading back what it actually did.

**Mutation that defeats it:** wrap the statement in dead code —
`if (false && w) w.textContent = s.word;`. The exact substring `w.textContent = s.word` is
still sitting in the file, byte-identical, so the source-text match still passes. The
statement never runs.

**Guard form that survives:** drive the REAL function through a REAL state transition and
read the value back off the actual rendered node (or return value) — never off the source.

**Found:** `tests/wallnav.test.mjs` tests 12b/12c (CMX-230) — `tests/dashboard_scale_nav_a11y.test.mjs`'s
GUARD 3a only source-matched `_applyWallTileFrame`'s repaint statements; dead-coding either
one left the regex green. 12b/12c instead flip a live `session_status` and assert the
`.gs-state-word`/`.gs-state-glyph` text actually changed on the DOM node.
